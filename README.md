## Assignment

Build a simplified version of a website for managing online auctions. For the
sake of simplicity, the web site considers only one auction, and users can bid
only multiples of 0.01 euros. The initial bid value is set automatically by the
system to 1.00 euros.

The website must have the following features:

01. On the home page of the site, one can view the highest bid value (called
    simply `BID` in the following), along with who did it, displaying the
    corresponding email.
02. Each user can sign up freely on the site by providing a username, which must
    be a valid email address, and a password, which must contain at least one
    alphabetic character and one numeric character (the user must be warned
    otherwise, before sending username and password to the server). A user `i`,
    after signing up or authenticating (if already signed up), can set a maximum
    value (`THR_i`), greater than `BID`, which the user is willing to bid at
    auction, so that the system automatically bids on the userâ€™s behalf with the
    mechanism described below. `THR_i` is kept secret by the system and is shown
    to the user only if authenticated. The `THR_i` value can be changed at any
    time by the authenticated user.
03. The auction mechanism works as follows. Whenever a new value of `THR_i` is
    entered on the user's personal page, the system automatically checks that it
    is greater than the current `BID` value, otherwise, the operation is canceled
    and a special error message is displayed to the user. After having set the
    `THR_i`, the system proceeds as described in item 4 to determine the new `BID`
    value visible to everyone, and the user is informed of the outcome of the
    operation ("you are the highest bidder" or "bid exceeded").
04. Determining the new `BID` value: when a new value of `THR_i` is entered, it
    is compared, internally by the system, with the `THR_i` values already set
    by other users. The user with the maximum value of `THR_i` is selected by
    the system, and the `BID` value is set to the maximum of the `THR_i` of all
    users other than the selected one, adding 0.01 euros. All the `THR_i` of
    other users will be reported, on each user's personal page, when the user is
    authenticated, as "bid exceeded". If there are no other users with `THR_i`
    set, `BID` is left unchanged. If there are two or more users with the same
    value of `THR_i`, the user who entered the bid first is selected and his/her
    `THR_i` becomes the new `BID`.
05. The system should not keep the history of operations but only the current
    state for each user.
06. Once authenticated, the user can continue to make `THR_i` settings with the
    procedure described above but without the need to authenticate or sign up
    again. There must be a command to cancel authentication (i.e. to log out).
07. Authentication through username and password remains valid if no more than
    two minutes have elapsed since the last page load. If a user attempts to
    perform an operation that requires authentication after an idle time of more
    than 2 minutes, the operation has no effect and the user is forced to
    re-authenticate with username and password. The use of HTTPS must be
    enforced for sign up and authentication and in any part of the site that
    displays private information of an authenticated user.
08. The general layout of the web pages must contain: a header in the upper part,
    a navigation bar on the left side with links or buttons to carry out the
    possible operations and a central part which is used for the main operation.
09. Cookies and Javascript must be enabled, otherwise the website may not work
    properly (in that case, for what concerns cookies, the user must be alerted
    and the website navigation must be forbidden, for what concerns Javascript
    the user must be informed). Forms should be provided with small
    informational messages in order to explain the meaning of the different
    fields. These messages may be put within the fields themselves or may appear
    when the mouse pointer is over them.
10. The more uniform the views and the layouts are by varying the adopted
    browser, the better.
